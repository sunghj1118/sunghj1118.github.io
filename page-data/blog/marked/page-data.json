The images were not being displayed and the markdown was not being rendered. I had to find a way to render the markdown files properly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/first_post/2024-05-14-12.31.08PM.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Eventually I was able to find a solution for the 'marked.js' library. I used the following code to render the markdown files properly.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&#x3C;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>❓ Why did I choose marked.js?</p>\n<p>I chose marked.js because it is a fast markdown parser and compiler. I also found a lot of resources online that helped me set it up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>❓ Why were the full image paths not working?</p>\n<p>The full image paths were not working because I was serving locally from a lower directory. The image paths weren't being recognized due to this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/images/first_post/2024-05-14-12.41.30PM.png\" alt=\"alt text\"><br>\nIn the image above, the image path is being recognized.\n<img src=\"/images/first_post/2024-05-14-12.44.02PM.png\" alt=\"alt text\">\nHowever, in the image above, the image path is not being recognized despite having the same path in the link. This is due to the server being open in a higher directory.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/marked/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
