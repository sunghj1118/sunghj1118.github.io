Training a FM from scratch is expensive and time-consuming. RAG can overcome these limitations by proposing a solution that is cost-effective and efficient.</li>\n<li><strong>Relevant Information</strong>: RAG can retrieve information from a knowledge base that is relevant to the current time context. This ensures that the information generated by the model is up-to-date.</li>\n<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: RAG can return more accurate information by retrieving data and providing sources for the information generated by the model.</li>\n<li><strong>Control</strong>: RAG allows for more control over the information generated by the model. This is because the model can be trained to retrieve information from a specific knowledge base.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>How does RAG work?</h1>\n<p>In classic LLMs, the model generates text based on its training data. In RAG, relevant information is retrieved from a new knowledge base and used to generate text. Then the retrieved information and user query are both given to the LLM. The LLM then uses both the new knowledge and its training data to generate a response.</p>\n<p>The diagram below shows the process of RAG (source: AWS):\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 59.00000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"diagram\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/67848ed9f7c6964b40ebd02189f2bc1a/5a190/rag-diagram.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/67848ed9f7c6964b40ebd02189f2bc1a/772e8/rag-diagram.png 200w,\n/static/67848ed9f7c6964b40ebd02189f2bc1a/e17e5/rag-diagram.png 400w,\n/static/67848ed9f7c6964b40ebd02189f2bc1a/5a190/rag-diagram.png 800w,\n/static/67848ed9f7c6964b40ebd02189f2bc1a/84cc5/rag-diagram.png 898w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create External Data</strong>: The new data outside of the LLM's original training data set is called external data. It can be from multiple sources and can exist in various formats. Embedding Language Models, a method that converts data into numerical representations and stores it into a vector DB, create a knowledge library that the AI can understand.</li>\n<li><strong>Retrieve</strong>: The query is converted into a vector representation which is compared to the vector DB to create a relevancy search.</li>\n<li><strong>Augment Prompt</strong>: The retrieved information is added to the prompt. The prompt is the input given to the LLM.</li>\n<li><strong>Update Data</strong>: To maintain current information, we can update the external data by asynchronously updating the documents through either real-time automation or periodic batch processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Possible Applications of RAG</h1>\n<p>The biggest possible application of RAG in my opinion is the efficient tuning of LLMs for specific domains. This can be expected even more so in the case of chatbots specific to particular companies or domains. For example, the medical and judicial sectors often face challenges when creating chatbots due to strict regulations and consequences regarding the generation of false or incorrect information. LLMs can often provide false or outdated information, which can be detrimental in these sectors. This problem can also be seen in company-specific chatbots where the chatbot might not be able to provide the correct answers relevant to the company, such as the company's policies or procedures. RAG can help overcome these challenges by providing the chatbot with the correct information from a knowledge base that is relevant to the domain. This in turn can help the chatbot generate more accurate and relevant information.</p>\n<h3>Sources:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\">https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/AI/rag/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
